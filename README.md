Idea:
Trying to create a handwritten letter website where you can write a letter (add text)attach images , tea bag stickers, pressed flowers stickers, you can add a spotify sound that can play on the letter ; you can attach candy stickers in letter. 
Then you can send that letter in an envelope where you can further have customised stamps. 
The person who will receive this will be displayed an envelope , they will click it and the read only copy of letter will come out.

 - mix of nostalgia and digital creativity.
- recreating the charm of a handwritten, decorated letter in a way that feels real but is convenient and shareable online.

ðŸ’Œ

Personalization â€“ Stickers, pressed flowers, a Spotify song, and even a custom stamp make it feel unique.

Emotional connection â€“ The envelope-opening animation makes it feel like a real letter, adding anticipation.

Modern + Vintage â€“ Combines old-school letter writing with digital convenience.
